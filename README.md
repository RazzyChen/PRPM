# PRPM
Recently, we collected some polypeptide sequences date from MS/MS. Next, we will generate its conformation to input other algorithms such as MD, docking, etc.. it doesn't predict polypeptide 3D structure, just generated conformation which to be consistent with psi/phi angle distribution and protein geometry.
